    This is some bunch of untagged text. No separation oh
    nooo!. Even if i put a space between this.
    <p>
      With a paragraph tag I can now see some separation.
      Even if the text just keeps going on and on. And it
      will keep going on until I stop typing. Who knowas
      when that will be? I certainly don't and I am the one
      deciding... What does it mean?

    <p>Here is more text</p>
    <!-- This is a comment and should not be seen -->

      This is some text in <b>bolded</b> and this is
      <i>italic</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      New semantics: <strong>strong</strong> and
      <em>emphasized</em>
